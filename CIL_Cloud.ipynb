        "In this blog, we will demonstrate how to use the Core Imaging Library (CIL), an open source software for imaging inverse problems, on cloud platforms like Binder and Google Colab. These platforms offer cloud-based environments with pre-installed packages and resources, making them highly suitable for teaching and training purposes. In addition, if you do not have a GPU or you are a macOS user without GPU or without the right GPU these cloud platforms serve as an excellent alternative. Or maybe you lost connection to your Windows/Linux remote machines and you really want to reconstruct a tomographic dataset.\n",

However, in this case only CPU is available which is not the best option for tomography imaging. Also, you have limited memory and space if you want to upload some tomography datasets. A couple years ago, Binder was quite fast when building your image and if the image was recently built you could see the interactive demos in less than one minute. Nowdays, Binderhub servers have a lot of activity with many users and requesting a server can take a lot of time and sometimes you will receive a message such as : _Found built image, launching... Too many users on this BinderHub! Try again soon._. \n",

Therefore, we need to use `pip` or `conda` to install our software. Pip is the default option to install python libraries on Google Colab, e.g., `!pip install name_of_package`. Unfortunately, Conda is not available by default and we need to install it first and then use it, e.g., `!conda install name_of_package`.\n",
